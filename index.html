    <h3 class="cta-font">Even if I die let India win World Cup :- YUVI</h3>
    <p id="yuvipa">Yuvi, the fighter:-
      Yuvraj played in the 2011 World Cup without realising he was fighting cancer, which was taking a massive toll on his body during the coveted tournament. Yuvraj was even seen coughing blood while batting in the middle of a match against the West Indies, but the renowned cricketer never considered leaving and continued to bat for India despite the pain. In the game, he scored a magnificent century and was named player of the match for his outstanding performance.</p>
